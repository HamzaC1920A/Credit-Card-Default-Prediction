# Credit Card Default Prediction

This project explores the factors that influence credit card defaults using a machine learning approach. 

## Project Goals

- Analyze a credit card default dataset to understand the characteristics of defaulters and non-defaulters.
- Identify key features that contribute to credit card defaults.
- Build a machine learning model to predict future defaults based on these features.  

## Data Exploration

- This section describes the data source, format, and any cleaning steps performed (missing value handling, feature engineering).
- Include visualizations (charts, plots) to explore data distribution, relationships between features, and potential patterns related to defaults.

## Model Building 

- logistic regression, random forest, etc.


## Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
